This is my Ruby translation to Peter Norvig's [What is Cheryl's Birthday][norvig-cheryl-py].

# When is Cheryl's Birthday?

1. Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gave them a list of 10 possible dates:

    ```
        May 15     May 16     May 19
       June 17    June 18
       July 14    July 16
     August 14  August 15  August 17
    ```

2. Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of the birthday respectively.
3. Albert: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know too.
4. Bernard: At first I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now.
5. Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.
6. So when is Cheryl's birthday?
